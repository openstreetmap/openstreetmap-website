API CHANGES FOR EDITOR AUTHORS
==============================

See

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/REST#Changes_in_the_upcoming_0.4_API

HACKING
=======

log in to your site (proably localhost:3000)

create a user and confirm it

you want to play with the API (probably at localhost:3000/api/0.4/node/create etc)

Lots of tests are needed to test the API.

Lots of little things to make the site work like the old one.

Also see the 'rails_port' component for bugs:
http://trac.openstreetmap.org/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&component=rails_port&order=priority
