= Ruby OpenID Test Server (ROTS), a dummy OpenID server that makes consumer tests dead easy.

ROTS is a minimal implementation of an OpenID server, developed on top of the Rack middleware, this
server provides an easy to use interface to make testing OpenID consumers really easy.

== No more mocks

Have you always wanted to test the authentication of an OpenID consumer implementation, but find your self 
in a point where is to hard to mock? A lot of people have been there. 

With ROTS, you only need to specify an identity url provided by the dummy server, passing with it a flag
saying that you want the authentication to be successful. It handles SREG extensions as well.

== How does it works

When you install the ROTS gem, a binary called rots is provided for starting the server (for more
info about what options you have when executing this file, check the -h option). 

By default, rots will have a test user called "John Doe", with an OpenID identity "john.doe". 
If you want to use your own test user name, you can specify a config file to rots. The
default configuration file looks like this:

# Default configuration file
identity: john.doe
sreg:
  nickname: jdoe
  fullname: John Doe
  email: jhon@doe.com
  dob: 1985-09-21
  gender: M

You can specify a new config file using the option --config.

== Getting Started

The best way to get started, is running the rots server, and then starting to execute your OpenID consumer tests/specs. You just have to specify the identity url of your test user, if you want the OpenID response be successful just add the openid.success=true flag to the user identity url. If you don't specify the flag it 
will return a cancel response instead.

Example:

it "should authenticate with OpenID" do
  post("/consumer_openid_login", 'identity_url' => 'http://localhost:1132/john.doe?openid.success=true')
end
