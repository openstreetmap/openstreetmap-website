    # This is probably the most common call of all. It is used for getting the
    # OSM data for a specified bounding box, usually for editing. First the
    # bounding box (bbox) is checked to make sure that it is sane. All nodes
    # are searched, then all the ways that reference those nodes are found.
    # All Nodes that are referenced by those ways are fetched and added to the list
    # of nodes.
    # Then all the relations that reference the already found nodes and ways are
    # fetched. All the nodes and ways that are referenced by those ways are then
    # fetched. Finally all the xml is returned.
