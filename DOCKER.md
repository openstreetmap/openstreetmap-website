# Using Docker and Docker Compose for Development and Testing

These instructions are designed for setting up `openstreetmap-website` for development and testing using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This will allow you to install the OpenStreetMap application and all its dependencies in Docker images and then run them in containers, almost with a single command.

## Install Docker

### Windows

1. Use Docker Desktop via [docker.com Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. You have to enable git symlinks before cloning the repository.
   This repository uses symbolic links that are not enabled by default on Windows git. To enable them, [turn on Developer Mode](https://windowsreport.com/windows-11-developer-mode/) on Windows and run `git config --global core.symlinks true` to enable symlinks in Git. See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917249/git-symbolic-links-in-windows) for more information.

### Mac

- Use Docker Desktop via [docker.com Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- Or [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/docker).

### Linux

Use [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) with the [docker-compose-plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

## Clone repository

The first step is to fork/clone the repo to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website.git

Now change working directory to the `openstreetmap-website`:

    cd openstreetmap-website

## Initial Setup

### Storage

    cp config/example.storage.yml config/storage.yml

### Database

    cp config/docker.database.yml config/database.yml

## Prepare local settings file

This is a workaround. [See issues/2185 for details](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/2185#issuecomment-508676026).

    touch config/settings.local.yml

**Windows users:** `touch` is not an availible command in Windows so just create a `settings.local.yml` file in the `config` directory, or if you have WSL you can run `wsl touch config/settings.local.yml`.

## Installation

To build local Docker images run from the root directory of the repository:

    docker compose build

If this is your first time running or you have removed cache this will take some time to complete. Once the Docker images have finished building you can launch the images as containers.

To launch the app run:

    docker compose up -d

This will launch one Docker container for each 'service' specified in `docker-compose.yml` and run them in the background. There are two options for inspecting the logs of these running containers:

- You can tail logs of a running container with a command like this: `docker compose logs -f web` or `docker compose logs -f db`.
- Instead of running the containers in the background with the `-d` flag, you can launch the containers in the foreground with `docker compose up`. The downside of this is that the logs of all the 'services' defined in `docker-compose.yml` will be intermingled. If you don't want this you can mix and match - for example, you can run the database in background with `docker compose up -d db` and then run the Rails app in the foreground via `docker compose up web`.

### Migrations

Run the Rails database migrations:

    docker compose run --rm web bundle exec rails db:migrate

### Tests

Prepare the test database:

     docker compose run --rm web bundle exec rails db:test:prepare

Run the test suite:

    docker compose run --rm web bundle exec rails test:all

### Loading an OSM extract

This installation comes with no geographic data loaded. You can either create new data using one of the editors (Potlatch 2, iD, JOSM etc) or by loading an OSM extract. Here an example for loading an OSM extract into your Docker-based OSM instance.

For example, let's download the District of Columbia from Geofabrik or [any other region](https://download.geofabrik.de):

    wget https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/district-of-columbia-latest.osm.pbf

You can now use Docker to load this extract into your local Docker-based OSM instance:

    docker compose run --rm web osmosis \
        -verbose    \
        --read-pbf district-of-columbia-latest.osm.pbf \
        --log-progress \
        --write-apidb \
            host="db" \
            database="openstreetmap" \
            user="openstreetmap" \
            validateSchemaVersion="no"

**Windows users:** Powershell uses `` ` `` and CMD uses `^` at the end of each line, e.g.:

    docker compose run --rm web osmosis `
        -verbose    `
        --read-pbf district-of-columbia-latest.osm.pbf `
        --log-progress `
        --write-apidb `
            host="db" `
            database="openstreetmap" `
            user="openstreetmap" `
            validateSchemaVersion="no"

Once you have data loaded for Washington, DC you should be able to navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/#map=12/38.8938/-77.0146`](http://localhost:3000/#map=12/38.8938/-77.0146) to begin working with your local instance.

### Additional Configuration

See [`CONFIGURE.md`](CONFIGURE.md) for information on how to manage users and enable OAuth for iD, JOSM etc.

### Bash

If you want to get into a web container and run specific commands you can fire up a throwaway container to run bash in via:

    docker compose run --rm web bash

Alternatively, if you want to use the already-running `web` container then you can `exec` into it via:

    docker compose exec web bash

Similarly, if you want to `exec` in the db container use:

    docker compose exec db bash
