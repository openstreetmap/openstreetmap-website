            the OpenStreetMap community and add or repair the data yourself.
        add_a_note:
          instructions_html: Just click <a class='icon note'></a> or the same icon
            on the map display. This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
            by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will
            investigate.

      introduction_html: Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the
        world. Now that you're signed up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's
        a quick guide with the most important things you need to know.
      whats_on_the_map:
        title: What's on the Map
        on_html: OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both <em>real
          and current</em> - it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details
          about places. You can map whatever real-world features are interesting to
          you.
        off_html: What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings,
          historical or hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources.
          Unless you have special permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
      basic_terms:
        title: Basic Terms For Mapping
        paragraph_1_html: OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few
          key words that'll come in handy.
        editor_html: An <strong>editor</strong> is a program or website you can use
          to edit the map.
        node_html: A <strong>node</strong> is a point on the map, like a single restaurant
          or a tree.
        way_html: A <strong>way</strong> is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake
          or building.
        tag_html: A <strong>tag</strong> is a bit of data about a node or way, like
          a  restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
      rules:
        title: Rules!
        paragraph_1_html: "OpenStreetMap has few formal rules but we expect all participants
          to collaborate\nwith, and communicate with, the community. If you are considering\nany
          activities other than editing by hand, please read and follow the guidelines
          on \n<a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines'>Imports</a>
          and \n<a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct'>Automated
          Edits</a>."
      questions:
        title: Any questions?
        paragraph_1_html: |-
          OpenStreetMap has several resources for learning about the project, asking and answering questions, and collaboratively discussing and documenting mapping topics.

      start_mapping: Start Mapping
      add_a_note:
        title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
        paragraph_1_html: If you just want something small fixed and don't have the
          time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's easy to add a note.
        paragraph_2_html: 'Just go to <a href=''%{map_url}''>the map</a> and click
          the note icon: <span class=''icon note''></span>. This will add a marker
          to the map, which you can move by dragging. Add your message, then click
          save, and other mappers will investigate.'
