  welcome_page:
    title: Welcome!
    introduction_html: |
      Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. Now that you're signed
      up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
      things you need to know.
    whats_on_the_map:
      title: What's on the Map
      on_html: |
        OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both <em>real and current</em> -
        it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
        whatever real-world features are interesting to you.
      off_html: |
        What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings, historical or
        hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources. Unless you have special
        permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
    basic_terms:
      title: Basic Terms For Mapping
      paragraph_1_html: |
        OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
      editor_html: |
        An <strong>editor</strong> is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
      node_html: |
        A <strong>node</strong> is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
      way_html: |
        A <strong>way</strong> is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
      tag_html: |
        A <strong>tag</strong> is a bit of data about a node or way, like a
        restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
    questions:
      title: Any questions?
      paragraph_1_html: |
        OpenStreetMap has several resources for learning about the project, asking and answering
        questions, and collaboratively discussing and documenting mapping topics.

    start_mapping: Start Mapping
    add_a_note:
      title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
      paragraph_1_html: |
        If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
        easy to add a note.
      paragraph_2_html: |
        Just go to <a href='%{map_url}'>the map</a> and click the note icon:
        <span class='icon note'></span>. This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
        by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.

        title: Join the community
        explanation_html: |
          If you have noticed a problem with our map data, for example a road is missing or your address, the best way to
          proceed is to join the OpenStreetMap community and add or repair the data yourself. 
      add_a_note:
        instructions_html: |
          Just click <a class='icon note'></a> or the same icon on the map display.
          This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
          by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.

      OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data
      about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.
    local_knowledge_title: Local Knowledge
    local_knowledge_html: |
      OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use
      aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM
