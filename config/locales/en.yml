        OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data
        about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.
      local_knowledge_title: Local Knowledge
      local_knowledge_html: |
        OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use
        aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM
        is accurate and up to date.
      community_driven_title: Community Driven
      community_driven_1_html: |
        OpenStreetMap's community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day.
        Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers
        running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas,
        and many more.

        credit_title_html: How to credit OpenStreetMap
        credit_1_html: |
          Where you use OpenStreetMap data, you are required to do the following two things:
        credit_2_1: Provide credit to OpenStreetMap by displaying our copyright notice.
        credit_2_2: Make clear that the data is available under the Open Database License.
        credit_3_html: |
         For the copyright notice, we have different requirements on how this should be
         displayed, depending on how you are using our data. For example, different
         rules apply on how to show the copyright notice depending on whether you have
         created a browsable map, a printed map or a static image. Full details on the
         requirements can be found in the %{attribution_guidelines_link}.

        credit_3_attribution_guidelines_url: https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence/Attribution_Guidelines

          To make clear that the data is available under the Open
          Database License, you may link to %{this_copyright_page_link}.
          Alternatively, and as a requirement if you are distributing OSM in a
          data form, you can name and link directly to the license(s). In media
          where links are not possible (e.g. printed works), we suggest you
          direct your readers to openstreetmap.org (perhaps by expanding
          'OpenStreetMap' to this full address) and to opendatacommons.org.
          In this example, the credit appears in the corner of the map.

            Just click %{note_icon} or the same icon on the map display.
            This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
            by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.

      introduction: |
        Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. Now that you're signed
        up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
        things you need to know.
      whats_on_the_map:
        title: What's on the Map
        on_the_map_html: |
          OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both %{real_and_current} -
          it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
          whatever real-world features are interesting to you.
        real_and_current: real and current
        off_the_map_html: |
          What it %{doesnt} include is opinionated data like ratings, historical or
          hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources. Unless you have special
          permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
        doesnt: doesn't
      basic_terms:
        title: Basic Terms For Mapping
        paragraph_1: |
          OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
        an_editor_html: An %{editor} is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
        a_node_html: A %{node} is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
        a_way_html: A %{way} is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
        a_tag_html: A %{tag} is a bit of data about a node or way, like a restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
        editor: editor
        node: node
        way: way
        tag: tag
      rules:
        title: Rules!
        para_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has few formal rules but we expect all participants to collaborate
          with, and communicate with, the community. If you are considering
          any activities other than editing by hand, please read and follow the guidelines on
          %{imports_link} and %{automated_edits_link}.
        imports: Imports
        imports_url: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines
        automated_edits: Automated Edits
        automated_edits_url: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct
      start_mapping: Start Mapping
      continue_authorization: Continue Authorization
      add_a_note:
        title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
        para_1: |
          If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
          easy to add a note.
        para_2_html: |
          Just go to %{map_link} and click the note icon: %{note_icon}.
          This will add a marker to the map, which you can move by dragging.
          Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.

    communities:
      title: Communities
      lede_text: |
        People from all over the world contribute to or use OpenStreetMap.
        While many participate as individuals, others have formed communities.
        These groups come in a range of sizes and represent geographies from small towns to large multi-country regions.
        They can also be formal or informal.
      hosted_communities:
        title: Hosted Communities
        communities: Communities
        para_1: |
          Some communities and their events are hosted here on OpenStreetMap's main website.
      local_chapters:
        title: Local Chapters
        about_text: |
          Local Chapters are country-level or region-level groups that have taken the formal step of
          establishing not-for-profit legal entities. They represent the area's map and mappers when
          dealing with local government, business, and media. They have also formed an affiliation
          with the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF), giving them a link to the legal and copyright
          governing body.
        list_text: |
          The following communities are formally established as Local Chapters:
      other_groups:
        title: Other Groups
        other_groups_html: |
          There is no need to formally establish a group to the same extent as the Local Chapters.
          Indeed many groups exist very sucessfully as an informal gathering of people or as a
          community group. Anyone can set up or join these. Read more on the %{communities_wiki_link}.
