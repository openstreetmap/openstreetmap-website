        paragraph_1_html: |
          If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
          easy to add a note.
        paragraph_2_html: |
          Just go to <a href='%{map_url}'>the map</a> and click the note icon:
          <span class='icon note'></span>. This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
          by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.
        title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
      basic_terms:
        editor_html: |
          An <strong>editor</strong> is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
        node_html: |
          A <strong>node</strong> is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
        tag_html: |
          A <strong>tag</strong> is a bit of data about a node or way, like a
          restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
        title: Basic Terms For Mapping
        way_html: |
          A <strong>way</strong> is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
      introduction_html: |
        Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. Now that you're signed
        up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
        things you need to know.
      questions:
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has several resources for learning about the project, asking and answering
          questions, and collaboratively discussing and documenting mapping topics.
          <a href='%{help_url}'>Get help here</a>. With an organization making plans for OpenStreetMap? <a href='https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/'>Check out the Welcome Mat</a>.
        title: Any questions?
      rules:
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has few formal rules but we expect all participants to collaborate
          with, and communicate with, the community. If you are considering
          any activities other than editing by hand, please read and follow the guidelines on
          <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines'>Imports</a> and
          <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct'>Automated Edits</a>.

        off_html: |
          What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings, historical or
          hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources. Unless you have special
          permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
        on_html: |
          OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both <em>real and current</em> -
          it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
          whatever real-world features are interesting to you.
