        credit_title_html: How to credit OpenStreetMap
        credit_1_html: |
          Where you use OpenStreetMap data, you are required to do the following two things:
        credit_2_1_html: |
          <ul>
            <li>Provide credit to OpenStreetMap by displaying our copyright notice.</li>
            <li>Make clear that the data is available under the Open Database License.</li>
          </ul>
        credit_3_1_html: |
         For the copyright notice, we have different requirements on how this should be 
         displayed, depending on how you are using our data. For example, different 
         rules apply on how to show the copyright notice depending on whether you have 
         created a browsable map, a printed map or a static image. Full details on the 
         requirements can be found in the 
         <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence/Attribution_Guidelines">Attribution 
         Guidelines</a>. 
        credit_4_html: |
          To make clear that the data is available under the Open
          Database License, you may link to
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this copyright page</a>.
          Alternatively, and as a requirement if you are distributing OSM in a
          data form, you can name and link directly to the license(s). In media
          where links are not possible (e.g. printed works), we suggest you
          direct your readers to openstreetmap.org (perhaps by expanding
          'OpenStreetMap' to this full address) and to opendatacommons.org.
          In this example, the credit appears in the corner of the map.

            If you have noticed a problem with our map data, for example a road is missing or your address, the best way to
            proceed is to join the OpenStreetMap community and add or repair the data yourself.

          instructions_html: |
            Just click <a class='icon note'></a> or the same icon on the map display.

    welcome:
      title: Welcome!
      introduction_html: |
        Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. Now that you're signed
        up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
        things you need to know.
      whats_on_the_map:
        title: What's on the Map
        on_html: |
          OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both <em>real and current</em> -
          it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
          whatever real-world features are interesting to you.
        off_html: |
          What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings, historical or
          hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources. Unless you have special
          permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
      basic_terms:
        title: Basic Terms For Mapping
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
        editor_html: |
          An <strong>editor</strong> is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
        node_html: |
          A <strong>node</strong> is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
        way_html: |
          A <strong>way</strong> is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
        tag_html: |
          A <strong>tag</strong> is a bit of data about a node or way, like a
          restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
      rules:
        title: Rules!
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has few formal rules but we expect all participants to collaborate
          with, and communicate with, the community. If you are considering
          any activities other than editing by hand, please read and follow the guidelines on
          <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines'>Imports</a> and
          <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct'>Automated Edits</a>.
      questions:
        title: Any questions?
        paragraph_1_html: |
          OpenStreetMap has several resources for learning about the project, asking and answering
          questions, and collaboratively discussing and documenting mapping topics.
          <a href='%{help_url}'>Get help here</a>. With an organization making plans for OpenStreetMap? <a href='https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/'>Check out the Welcome Mat</a>.
      start_mapping: Start Mapping
      add_a_note:
        title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
        paragraph_1_html: |
          If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
          easy to add a note.
        paragraph_2_html: |
          Just go to <a href='%{map_url}'>the map</a> and click the note icon:
          <span class='icon note'></span>. This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
          by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.
