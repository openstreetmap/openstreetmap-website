      <h3>How to credit OpenStreetMap</h3>
      <p>
        If you are using OpenStreetMap map images, we request that
        your credit reads at least &ldquo;&copy; OpenStreetMap
        contributors, CC BY-SA&rdquo;. If you are using map data only,
        we request &ldquo;Map data &copy; OpenStreetMap contributors,
        CC BY-SA&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where possible, OpenStreetMap should be hyperlinked to <a
        href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">http://www.openstreetmap.org/</a>
        and CC BY-SA to <a
        href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/</a>. If
        you are using a medium where links are not possible (e.g. a
        printed work), we suggest you direct your readers to
        www.openstreetmap.org (perhaps by expanding
        &lsquo;OpenStreetMap&rsquo; to this full address) and to
        www.creativecommons.org.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding out more</h3>

        href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ">Legal
        FAQ</a>.

      <p>
        OSM contributors are reminded never to add data from any
        copyrighted sources (e.g. Google Maps or printed maps) without
        explicit permission from the copyright holders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although OpenStreetMap is open data, we cannot provide a
        free-of-charge map API for third-party developers.

        See our <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_usage_policy">API Usage Policy</a>,

      <h3>Our contributors</h3>
      <p>
        Our CC BY-SA licence requires you to &ldquo;give the Original
        Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are
        utilising&rdquo;. Individual OSM mappers do not request a
        credit over and above that to &ldquo;OpenStreetMap
        contributors&rdquo;, but where data from a national mapping
        agency or other major source has been included in
        OpenStreetMap, it may be reasonable to credit them by directly
        reproducing their credit or by linking to it on this page.
      </p>
