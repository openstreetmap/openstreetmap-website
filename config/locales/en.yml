      credit_title_html: How to credit OpenStreetMap
      credit_1_html: |
        We require that you use the credit &ldquo;&copy; OpenStreetMap
        contributors&rdquo;.
      credit_2_html: |
        You must also make it clear that the data is available under the Open
        Database License, and if using our map tiles, that the cartography is
        licensed as CC-BY-SA. You may do this by linking to
        <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this copyright page</a>.
        Alternatively, and as a requirement if you are distributing OSM in a
        data form, you can name and link directly to the license(s). In media
        where links are not possible (e.g. printed works), we suggest you
        direct your readers to openstreetmap.org (perhaps by expanding
        'OpenStreetMap' to this full address), to opendatacommons.org, and
        if relevant, to creativecommons.org.
      credit_3_html: |
        For a browsable electronic map, the credit should appear in the corner of the map.
