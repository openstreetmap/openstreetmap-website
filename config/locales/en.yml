    title: Welcome!
    introduction_html: |
      Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. Now that you're signed
      up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
      things you need to know.
    whats_on_the_map:
      title: What's on the Map
      on_html: |
        OpenStreetMap is a place for mapping things that are both <em>real and current</em> -
        it includes millions of buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
        whatever real-world features are interesting to you.
      off_html: |
        What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings, historical or
        hypothetical features, and data from copyrighted sources. Unless you have special
        permission, don't copy from online or paper maps.
    basic_terms:
      title: Basic Terms For Mapping
      paragraph_1_html: |
        OpenStreetMap has some of its own lingo. Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
      editor_html: |
        An <strong>editor</strong> is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
      node_html: |
        A <strong>node</strong> is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
      way_html: |
        A <strong>way</strong> is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
      tag_html: |
        A <strong>tag</strong> is a bit of data about a node or way, like a
        restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
    questions:
      title: Any questions?
      paragraph_1_html: |
        OpenStreetMap has several resources for learning about the project, asking and answering
        questions, and collaboratively discussing and documenting mapping topics.
        <a href='%{help_url}'>Get help here</a>.

    add_a_note:
      title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
      paragraph_1_html: |
        If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
        easy to add a note.
      paragraph_2_html: |
        Just go to <a href='%{map_url}'>the map</a> and click the note icon:
        <span class='icon note'></span>. This will add a marker to the map, which you can move
        by dragging. Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.
  landing_page:
    title: Report a problem / Fix the map
    introduction_html: |
      You likely landed here because you followed a "Report a problem" or "Fix the map" link. Thank you for
      taking the time to help improve OpenStreetMap.
    how_to_help:
      title: How to Help
      explanation_html: |
        If you have noticed a problem with our map data, for example a road is missing or your address, the best way to
        proceed is to join the OpenStreetMap community and add or repair the data yourself. You can sign up
        <a href='/user/new'>here</a>. Please limit your additions to the content mentioned below, not everything has to be included
        in OpenStreetMap itself to be displayed together with our data. If you don't have time to edit please see the section below
        on adding a note.
        </p><p>
        If you have a legal concern about how our data is being used or about the contents please consult our

    lede_text: |
      OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data
      about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.
    local_knowledge_title: Local Knowledge
    local_knowledge_html: |
      OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use
      aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM
      is accurate and up to date.

    community_driven_html: |
      OpenStreetMap's community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day.
      Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers
      running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas,
      and many more.
      To learn more about the community, see the <a href='%{diary_path}'>user diaries</a>,
