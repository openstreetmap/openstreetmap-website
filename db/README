Creating database
===================

OSM server uses a Postgres database with the following name:

openstreetmap

You may create it with your preferable client or run next (linux) command:

$ createdb openstreetmap

Creating functions for PgSQL
==============================

Run this command in the db/functions directory:

$ make libpgosm.so

You might also need to install:
- postgresql development libraries: 	$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-8.3
- ruby development libraries: 		$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
for build to succeed.

Now create the function as follows:

$ psql openstreetmap
(This may need authentication or a -u <dbowneruid>)

> CREATE FUNCTION maptile_for_point(int8, int8, int4) RETURNS int4 
  AS '/path/to/rails-port/db/functions/libpgosm.so', 'maptile_for_point'
  LANGUAGE C STRICT;

Creating database skeleton tables
===================================

Run this command from the root of your rails directory:

$ rake db:migrate

This will create the db for you

You will need to make sure the database connection is configured in database.yml in config directory
You might start with example configuration provided: 
$ cp config/example.database.yml config/database.yml
